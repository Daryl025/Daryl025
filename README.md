# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

I go by Arold Daryl Tchouala, a young and passionate Junior developer. Majoring in the **Interactive Design| Web Design and Development** program at the *Southern Alberta Institute of Technology collage*. Aspiring to secure a career as a Full stack developer.

In the near future,  i aim to gain more practical experience through challenging internships, improve my proficiency in coding, and the usage of frameworks, get certifications, and coonect with other developers and professionals in the field through meetups and tech events.

Besides coding, i love playing soccer, reading, music, and watching movies.

## **I will share with you what i think should be the qualities of a good software developer and designer.**

- In my view, a good software engineer should possess a creative mindset, which can be cultivated with time rather than being innate. They should be able to communicate ideas clearly, conduct surveys, and discern between what is ideal from and what is not.

 - A good Software developer and designer should be driven by passion and demonstrate patience when working. He should also be willing to commit to lifelong learning, as technology is frequently  evolving.

 - Additionally, he should adaptable, and embrace collaboration with diverse teams and approach challenges with a proactive mindset.

### **What web development and designing looks like to me**

I see web development and designing like a world of sorcery/magic, filled with good sorcerers (Software Engineers). In this world, the muggles(respectfully) generate raw ideas based on their imagination or need of web solutions. They then solicitate sorcerers so they can perform some magic to satisfy their needs. In this magical world unlike others, the sorcerers donâ€™t just directly cast spells, but they follow a series of recommended steps to perform their magic. This procedure involves.

1. Design
2. Choosing potion (Technology)
3. Casting spells( Development)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance.

Some of the magical artifacts they use are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MYSQL, GitHub and VS Code out of hundreds.

#### *My thoughts about how the process went.*

- I had to read and assimilate what was required of me for this assignment.

- I had to create a public repository that matches my github username containing a README. md. file. In which had to make commits and push them into it.

- While completing this task, I learned about writing good commit messages, which consists of writing in the imperative mood, Being concise and descriptive, Capitalizing the first letters etc..

- I noticed that I could directly perform the commits on github but I preferred to do my writing on VScode and use github desktop to commit.

- Doing this permitted me to learn how to create a file on github, clone it and open it on github desktop, from there do the writing on VScode and commit. I chose this path because most of my work if not all will be done on a code editor and not on github.

- Lastly, I got my initiation into using Markdown formatting.   *LOVED IT !!!*
