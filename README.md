# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

# **I will share with you what i think should be the qualitiees of a good software developer and designer.**

- In my view, a good software engineer should possess a creative mindset, which can be cultivated with time rather than being innate. They should be able to communicate ideas clearly, conduct surveys, and discern between what is ideal from and what is not.

 - A good Software developer and designer should be driven by passion and demonstrate patience when working. He should also be willing to commit to lifelong learning, as technology is frequently  evolving.

 - Additionally, he should adaptable, and embrace collaboration with diverse teams and approach challenges with a proactive mindset.

## **What web development and designing looks like to me**

I see web development and designing like a world of sorcery/magic, filled with good sorcerers (Software Engineers). In this world, the muggles(respectfully) generate raw ideas based on their imagination or need of web solutions. They then solicitate sorcerers so they can perform some magic to satisfy their needs. In this magical world unlike others, the sorcerers donâ€™t just directly cast spells, but they follow a series of recommended steps to perform their magic. This procedure involves.

1. Design
2. Choosing potion (Technology)
3. Casting spells( Development)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance.

Some of the magical artifacts they use are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MYSQL, GitHub and VS Code out of hundreds.
